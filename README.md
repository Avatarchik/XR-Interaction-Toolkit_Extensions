# XR-Interaction-Toolkit Extensions
A set of extensions for Unitys XR Interaction Toolkit

This is supposed to extend the XR Interaction Toolkit of Unity with some usefull stuff.
I allways try to be as less intrusive in Unitys code as possible. Supporting as much of their systems as possible if possible.
