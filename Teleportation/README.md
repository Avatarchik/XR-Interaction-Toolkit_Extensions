This is an extension to the Locomotion System.

Teleporting is pretty basic in th XR Interaction Toolkit. With this scripts you'll be able to implement an Oculus Style Teleportation Flow.

Push the stick on your controller forward -> Rotate to chose the direction to look in after teleporting -> Release the stick.
Teleportation can be canceled by pressing the stick.

There is one adjustment to make in the XR Interaction Toolkit package.

Search for the XRController.cs file. Add "protected" in the two marked lines. This is necessary for the my scripts to hook into XR Interaction Toolkit.



If you find this usefull and woulkd like to support be, feel free to buy me a coffee =)
